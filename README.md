> "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) should be viewed as essential tools, akin to the finely tuned parts of a Formula 1 car. The act of problem-solving with DSA serves as a crucial platform to exhibit both intelligence and creative thinking. The coding challenges themselves are simply various permutations of external factors; like the weather, track, wind, and rain in an F1 race. Ultimately, what dictates success in both domains; coding and Formula 1; is the mastery of planning, strategizing, maintaining flow, and ensuring precise code orchestration." - Siddhant Bali

**RAM(Random-access memory)**

- Data Structures and RAM
  - A data structure is a way of structuring data.
  - In computer science, data structures involve structuring data inside of RAM (Random Access Memory).
  - RAM is where all variables are stored.
  - Example: An array containing the numbers 1, 3, and 5 is information stored in RAM.
- RAM Measurement and Composition
  - RAM is measured in bytes.
  - It is common for many computers to have 8 gigabytes of RAM.
  - Giga means about $10^9$, or approximately a billion.
  - A byte is eight bits.
  - A bit can be thought of as a position that stores a digit.
  - The restriction on the digit stored in a bit is that it can only be a zero or a one.
  - Zeros and ones are the language of computers.
  - Storage Hierarchy: Individual bits form multiple bits, which form bytes, which ultimately form RAM.
  - RAM is used to store advanced data structures.
- Storing Values and Addressing in RAM

  ```
  - RAM can be conceptually viewed as a contiguous block of data.
    - i.e. Nothing Can be B/w 2 adjacent blocks
  - RAM has two components: values and addresses.
  - Values are the data being stored.
  - Every value is stored at a distinct location called an address.
  - In representations, a dollar sign ($) may be used in front of every address to distinguish it from the stored values.
  - Example: The first address might be $0.
- Representation of Integers in RAM
  - It is common for integers to be represented by four bytes, not a single byte.
  - Four bytes is equivalent to 32 bits.
  - Example of storing the integer '1' using 32 bits:
    - The representation will be 31 zeros, followed by a single one at the end.
  - The process involves taking the value, representing it in terms of bytes, and then placing that representation into RAM.

**PreReqs**

- Arrays
  - Arrays are considered the most simple data structure.
  - **Definition/Key Property:** Arrays are always contiguous.
  - Contiguous storage means that nothing is stored in between the values of the array (e.g., nothing between the 3 and the 5).
  - Arrays look exactly the same in memory as they are represented conceptually: a contiguous set of values.
  - When storing an array in RAM, the starting location (address) is not always chosen by the user.
  - Arrays can store different types of values, such as integers or characters.
- Array Storage and Address Incrementing (The Size Rule)
  - Values are stored contiguously regardless of how large or small they are.
  - The address must be incremented by the size of the value being stored.

  - **Example: Storing 32-bit Integers (4 bytes)**
    ```
    Array: [ 1 | 3 | 5 ]
                |   |   |
        +-------+   |   +-------+
        |           |           |
        V           V           V
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
      | Value     |  1  |  3  |  5  |   ...    |
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
      | Address   | $0  | $4  | $8  |  $12 ... |
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
    ```
    - Each integer takes four bytes to store.
    - If the address stored the value '1' starting at address $0.
    - It uses four bytes ($0, $1, $2, $3).
    - The next value ('3') must be stored starting at address $4 (incremented by four).
    - The final value ('5') would be stored starting at address $8.
    - If each value only took one byte, the addresses would increment by one ($0, $1, $2), but 32-bit integers require four bytes.
  - **Example: Storing Characters (1 byte)**
    ```
    Array: [ a | b | c ]
                |   |   |
        +-------+   |   +-------+
        |           |           |
        V           V           V
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
      | Value     |  a  |  b  |  c  |   ...    |
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
      | Address   | $0  | $1  | $2  |   $3 ... |
      +-----------+-----+-----+-----+----------+
    ```
    - Characters (like A, B, C) are stored continuously.
    - Characters typically take only one byte to store in memory.
    - This one-byte size is typical when storing ASKY characters, although knowing the specific encoding (ASKY) is not super important.
    - If the first character 'A' starts at address $0.
    - The next address is incremented by one: 'B' is stored at address $1.
    - The next character 'C' is stored at address $2.
- Course Focus
  - The information presented covers theoretical aspects of memory and how arrays are stored.
  - This course will mostly focus on practical knowledge.
  - Upcoming topics will cover array properties, usage, and tradeoffs.

  - Array Definition and Structure
    - An array is defined as a **contiguous block of data**.
    - Arrays are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory) as a contiguous block of data.
  - Common Array Operations
    - The two most common operations for any data structure are reading to the data or writing to the data.
  - I. Reading Data from Arrays

          [Direct access via index = O(1)]
    ```
    - Indexing
      - Programmers use indexes to access values in an array.
      - The first value is **always at index zero**, not index one.
      - Subsequent values are at index one, two, etc..
    - Reading Mechanism
      - To read the first element of an array (e.g., `my array`), the intuitive action is to go to the first address in memory and read the value.
      - Under the hood, this is exactly what happens.
      - Programmers do not need to know the exact address of every single value.
      - When reading the value at index zero, the system automatically goes to that location in memory and reads the stored value.
    - Efficiency of Reading
      - Since any index in the array can be automatically mapped to a location in memory, any value can be read **instantly** if the index is available.
      - This efficient operation is represented by **big O of one (O(1))**.
      - O(1) means that in the worst case, reading a value (assuming the index is known, e.g., index 2) is an **instant operation**.
      - Reading happens in **constant time**, regardless of how large the array becomes.
    - Role of RAM
      - The ability to go to any arbitrary address in RAM and read the value is a property of RAM.
      - **RAM stands for Random Access Memory**.
      - Random access means memory can be accessed randomly in constant time.
      - We do not have to start from the beginning of RAM and keep looking for a value; we can access it automatically.
      - This is important because if there is a lot of RAM, we avoid going through the entire RAM every time.
      - If accessing the third value, we do not have to go through the first and second values.
    - Looping Through Arrays (Reading All Values)
      - After reading the first value, we read the second, third, and continue until the end of the array.
      - In code, reading a value at index `i` is typically represented by `my array at index i`.
      - The index `i` is incremented (to one, then two, etc.).
      - The loop stops when `i` equals the length of the array.
      - This process loops through the entire input array.
      - In most languages, this can be done using a `for loop` or a `while loop`.
  - II. Writing Data and Limitations of Static Arrays
    - Fixed Size Property
      - Arrays possess the property of **fixed size**.
      - Example: If an array was declared to hold three values, it is fixed size.
    - The Contiguity Constraint for Adding Values
      - If we want to add a fourth value (e.g., a seven) to an array of size three, the new value must be added to maintain contiguity.
      - Example: If the existing data ends just before address 12, the seven would need to be added precisely at address 12 to maintain a contiguous array of size four.
      - Limitations in RAM allocation prevent simple expansion.
        - We do not always get to decide exactly where RAM is allocated or where values are stored.
        - The required spot in RAM might already be used by another array or the operating system.
      - If a value is put anywhere else in memory, the array loses its contiguous property, resulting in two separate arrays, which is not the intended outcome.
      - Loss of Contiguity Breaks Operations
        - If contiguity is lost, looping through the array breaks.
        - Example: If a loop is at index two and increments to index three, it will attempt to access the expected contiguous spot; if the value is stored elsewhere, the operation will fail.
    - Static Arrays Defined
      - This fixed-size constraint is the biggest limitation of **static arrays**.
      - Static arrays are defined as **fixed size arrays**.
      - **Recommendation is to first define upperbound static arrays with initialisation with zeros or use vector array**
    - Static vs. Dynamic Arrays
      - Programming languages like Python or JavaScript often use **dynamic arrays** by default, which means programmers rarely encounter the fixed-size limitation or worry about running out of space.
    - Initialization
      - When a static array (e.g., size three) is allocated, there must be something stored in memory.
      - Default initialization varies:
        - Languages usually initialize values to all zero.
        - Sometimes they do not initialize them at all, resulting in random arbitrary values.
  - III. Overwriting and Efficient Operations (O(1))
    - Writing/Adding at the End
      - Adding a new value to the end of the array (at the next empty spot being tracked) is an **instant operation**.
      - We know the index (e.g., index 2) and thus instantly know the position in RAM.
      - **Writing to any position** is a **big O of one (O(1)) operation**; it is constant time.
      - Inserting a value at the end of the array is also a **big O of one (O(1))** time operation, assuming an empty space is available.
    - Removing/Overwriting
      - When "removing" a value in a static array, we cannot actually delete or deallocate it from memory.
      - Removal means **overwriting** the value (e.g., replacing it with a zero).
      - We effectively declare that the original value is "no longer relevant," even though it remains in memory.
      - **Removing a value** is also efficient: **big O of one (O(1))**.
      - It is a constant time operation because it involves going to that memory position and overwriting it (e.g., replacing it with a zero or negative 1).
      - Removing the value at the end of the array is a **big O of one (O(1))** time operation, assuming at least one element exists to remove.
    - Summary of Efficient Operations
      - Reading or overwriting the arbitrary element `E` (meaning any index) is done in **big O of one (O(1))** time, or constant time.
  - IV. Arbitrary Insertion and Removal (Inefficient Operations: O(N))
    - Ordered Values
      - In arrays, including static arrays, the **order of the values matters**.
      - Values are ordered because of the way indexes work (e.g., five comes before six).
    - Inserting into the Middle or Beginning
      - Inserting at an arbitrary position (middle or beginning) is **not efficient**.
      - If we simply overwrite an existing value to insert a new one, the desired order is lost (e.g., replacing five with four results in four, six, not four, five, six).
    - The Shifting Mechanism for Insertion
      - To insert a value (e.g., four) while maintaining order (e.g., four, five, six), the existing elements must be **shifted to the right**.
      - **Step 1: Shift existing values.** We must shift the elements starting from the end towards the right.
        - Example: Before shifting the five, the six must be shifted to prevent loss of data.
        - Six (at index 1) moves to index 1 + 1 (index 2).
        - Five (at index 0) moves to index 0 + 1 (index 1).
      - **Step 2: Insert the new value.** Only after shifting is completed can the new value (four) be placed in the now-available position (index 0).
      - **Downside:** This requires moving every existing value in the array.
    - Insertion Time Complexity (Worst Case)
      - Shifting many elements is **not very efficient**.
      - This operation is called **big O of N (O(N))**.
      - **N** refers to the **number of elements** in the array (the length), not the size of the array.
      - **Big O** notation refers to the **worst case** scenario.
      - **Worst Case for Insertion:** If inserting a value at the beginning of a filled array, we must shift every value in the array (N values) over to the right by one.
      - **Worst Case Time Complexity:** Inserting into the middle of an array is **big O of N**.
        - Note: While inserting into an empty array would be O(1), the worst case determines the Big O notation.
      - Example of a better case: If inserting between five and six to achieve five, four, six, only the six would need to be shifted (one value), not every value. However, the generalized worst case is still O(N).
    - Arbitrary Removal Time Complexity
      - Removing a value at an arbitrary index requires similar shifting.
      - Arbitrary removal means we want to act as if the value no longer exists, not just replace it with a zero.
    - The Shifting Mechanism for Removal
      - Removal requires shifting values to the **left**.
      - Example: If removing the value at index 0 from (5, 6, 7), the goal is to shift the 6 and 7 forward.
        - Six (at index 1) moves to index 1 - 1 (index 0).
        - Seven (at index 2) moves to index 2 - 1 (index 1).
      - Memory Note: The memory allocated for the element that was removed still exists and is reflected in RAM, even if the resulting array (6, 7) appears smaller.
      - **Worst Case Time Complexity:** Removing in the middle of an array is **big O of N (O(N))**, as we might have to shift every value.
- ARRAY PROPERTIES AND OPERATIONS (STATIC ARRAYS) CODE
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

// Insert n into arr at the next open position.
// Length is the number of 'real' values in arr, and capacity
// is the size (aka memory allocated for the fixed size array).
void insertEnd(int arr[], int n, int length, int capacity) {
    if (length < capacity) {
        arr[length] = n;
    }
}

// Remove from the last position in the array if the array
// is not empty (i.e. length is non-zero).
void removeEnd(int arr[], int length) {
    if (length > 0) {
        arr[length - 1] = 0;
    }
}

// Insert n into index i after shifting elements to the right.
// Assuming i is a valid index and arr is not full.
void insertMiddle(int arr[], int i, int n, int length) {
    for (int index = length - 1; index >= i; index--) {
        arr[index + 1] = arr[index];
    }   
    arr[i] = n;
}

// Remove value at index i before shifting elements to the left.
// Assuming i is a valid index.
void removeMiddle(int arr[], int i, int length) {
    for (int index = i + 1; index < length; index++) {
        arr[index - 1] = arr[index];
    }
}

void printArr(int arr[], int capacity) {
    for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << endl;
}

- Vector Array
```cpp
    // Vector Array
    // a way to store and access the list of elements.
    // dynamic array in C++ is std::vector
    // Why It's Useful: You don't need to know the exact number of elements you'll be storing ahead of time
    // #include <vector> // lib
    std::vector<int> arr1; // empty vector
    std::vector<int> arr2={1,2,3}; // initialised vector
    std::vector<int> arr3(5); // size =5, each element value=default value=0
    std::cout<<arr3[0]<<std::endl; //0 // Direct Access (0based)
    std::vector<int> arr4(5,90); // size =5, each element value=90
    std::cout<<arr4[0]<<std::endl; //90
    std::cout<<arr1.size()<<std::endl; //0 // Get Length
    arr4.push_back(5); // Append // btw each push in dynamic array is O(1)
    std::cout<<arr4[5]<<std::endl; //5
    for ( int i =0 ; i<arr2.size(); i++) { std::cout<<arr2[i]<<"    ";} // Vector array traversal
    std::cout<<std::endl;
    // std::vector it's just a dynamic array that you can access with integer indices (like tempo[0], tempo[1], etc.). It doesn't have a .find() method that takes a string, nor can you use a string inside the square brackets [].
    // The perfect tool for this is a std::unordered_map. It allows you to store key-value pairs, which is exactly what you need: the sorted string as the key and the list of anagrams as the value.

```
- Bucket/2D Vector
```cpp

    // std::vector<std::vector<int>> (Bucket/2D Vector)
    // What It Is: This is simply a vector where each element is another vector. You can visualize it as a 2D grid or a list of lists.
    // Why It's Useful: It's great for grouping items into "buckets." 
    //      For instance, you could have a main vector where the index represents a frequency. 
    //      The element at my_buckets[5] would then be a vector containing all the numbers that appeared 5 times. 
    //      This technique, often called Bucket Sort, is a powerful way to organize data by a specific property (like frequency).
    // Create a vector of 5 "buckets", where each bucket is an empty vector of ints.
    int num_buck =5 ;
    vector < vector<int> > buckets(num_buck);
    // Let's put numbers into buckets based on some property.
    // For example, put numbers 10 and 11 into bucket 2.
    buckets[2].push_back(10);
    buckets[2].push_back(11);
    // Put number 25 into bucket 4.

    std::cout<< "Items in bucket 2: ";
    for (int items: buckets[2]) // buckets[2], not buckets
    {
        std::cout << items << " "; // Output: 10 11
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    // Items in bucket 2: 10 11 
```
- For Loop
```cpp
    // For Loop
    for ( int i=0; i<5; i++) std::cout<<i;
    // 01234
```
- Range-Based for Loop
```cpp

    // Range-Based for Loop
    // What It Is: A cleaner, more modern syntax for a for loop that iterates through all the elements of a container (like a vector or map) without needing to manage indices or iterators manually.
    // Why It's Useful: It makes code much easier to read and write, and it reduces the chance of off-by-one errors with indices. You just declare a variable that will take the value of each element in the container, one by one.
    vector<int> numbers = { 1,2,3 };
    cout<< "nos:";
    // => 'num' will take the value of each element in 'numbers'.
    for (int num: numbers){
        cout<<num<<" "; // 1 2 3 
    }
    cout<<endl;
    // nos:1 2 3 
    // => It works with maps, too. 'const auto&' is efficient here.
    unordered_map<char, int> meow = { {'a',3}, {'b',5 }}; // "c" NO CHAR, 'c' YES CHAR
    cout<< "nos:";
    for ( const auto& pair : meow) {cout<<"{"<<pair.first<<","<<pair.second<<"}";}  // 'pair' is a key-value pair.
    cout<<endl;
    // nos:{b,5}{a,3}
```
- Hashset
```cpp
    // Hashset
    std::unordered_set<int> hashSet;
    hashSet.insert(1);
    std::cout<<(
        hashSet.find(1) 
        != 
        hashSet.end() // i.e if find give hashSet.end() ptr, then element doesnt exist
    )<<std::endl; // true as 1 exists in hashset 
    // 1
    // re-insert array elements in hashmap & checker while insertion: number not existed in hashmap tip
    //  // given: vector<int>& nums
    //     unordered_set<int> hashbrown; // re-insert array elements in hashmap
    //     for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){ 
    //         if ( hashbrown.find(nums[i]) != hashbrown.end() ) // checker while insertion: number not existed in hashmap
    //         {
    //         }
    //     }
    // ( hashbrown.find(nums[i] ) only returns ptr, not index, tip
```
- Sorting
```cpp
    // Sorting
    // #include <algorithm> // Required for std::sort

    // Sorting a string
    std::string word = "cab";
    std::sort(word.begin(), word.end());
    std::cout << "Sorted word: " << word << std::endl;
    // Sorted word: abc

    // std::sort with Reverse Iterators
    std::vector<int> data = {40, 10, 50, 20, 30};

    // 1. Sort in default ascending order
    std::sort(data.begin(), data.end());
    std::cout << "Ascending: ";
    for (int x : data) std::cout << x << " "; // Output: 10 20 30 40 50
    std::cout << std::endl;
    // Ascending: 10 20 30 40 50

    // 2. Sort in descending order using reverse iterators
    sort(data.rbegin(), data.rend());
    std::cout << "Descending: ";
    for (int x : data) std::cout << x << " "; // Output: 50 40 30 20 10
    std::cout << std::endl;    
    // Descending: 50 40 30 20 10

    // Sorting in Vector
    // (TC): O(nlogn) on average and in the worst case
    // (SC): O(logn)
    // std::sort sorts the vector in-place and does not return a sorted vector. Its return type is void
    std::vector<int> v1 = {1,4,2,0};
    std::cout<<"v1: "<<v1[0]<<" "<< v1[1] << " " << v1[2] << " " << v1[3] << std::endl;
    // v1: 1 4 2 0
    std::sort(v1.begin(), v1.end()); // asc default
    std::cout<<"v1(sorted): "<<v1[0]<<" "<< v1[1] << " " << v1[2] << " " << v1[3] << std::endl;
    // v1(sorted): 0 1 2 4
    std::sort(v1.begin(), v1.end(), std::greater<int>()); // dsc
    std::cout<<"v1(sorted dsc): "<<v1[0]<<" "<< v1[1] << " " << v1[2] << " " << v1[3] << std::endl;
    // v1(sorted dsc): 4 2 1 0
    // - Downside of This STL Sort
    //     - Differs from lang to lang
    //     - good sort algos do O(nlogn)
    //     - bad sort algos do O(n**2)
    //     - uncertain of SC
    //     - uncertain of TC
    //     - lenghty at cases where STL is not available
```
- unordered sets
```cpp
    // unordered sets in c++ contains unique elements
    // if we even insert duplicate, it will reject it
    // we can make unord set with method to copy full the vector array, rejecting the duplicates
    v1.push_back(1);
    v1.push_back(1);
    std::unordered_set<int> hashSet2(v1.begin(), v1.end()) ;// TC: O(n) avg tc, O(n**2) worst rare tc where glitches happen &SC: O(k) Avg, O(n) worst, k is number of unique elements
    std::cout<< hashSet2.size() << std::endl; // 4 // unique elements in unord set
    std::cout<< v1.size() << std::endl; // 6 // duplicates elements in vect arr
```
- string equality
```cpp
    string s = "aba" ;
    string t = "aab" ; 
    // string equality
    cout<< 
    ( s==t ) // SC: O(min(N,M)), TC: O(1)
    << endl; // 0
    // cout<<s==t<< endl; // NO, always use explicit brackets to avoid glitches
    sort(s.begin(),s.end());
    sort(t.begin(),t.end());
    cout<<( s==t )<< endl; // 1
```
- Storing Character Frequencies
```cpp
    // Storing Character Frequencies
    // Storing Character Frequencies Way 1: Dynamic Array/ Vector
    vector<int> counts(26,0); // Creates a vector of size 26, with all elements initialized to 0.
    // Since the problem states the strings only contain lowercase English letters, you don't need a flexible map. A simple array of size 26 is faster.
    // Here idx 0 -> 'a' -> 97
    // 25 -> 'z' -> 122
    char ch = 'a';
    counts[ch-97]++;
    counts[ch-97]++;
    cout<<counts[0]<<endl; //2

    // Storing Character Frequencies Way 2: Hashmap/ Unordered Map
    unordered_map<char,int> freq_map;
    freq_map['a']++; 
    // If 'a' isn't in the map, it's added with value 1.
    // If it is, its value is incremented.
    // it has capability of direct comparison
        // freq_map == freq_map2 is valid

```
- Hashmap/ Unordered Map
```cpp
    // Hashmap/ Unordered Map

    // Why It's Useful: It provides incredibly fast lookups, insertions, and deletions of elements. If you know the key, you can find its value almost instantly, no matter how many items are in the map. This is perfect for grouping items or counting frequencies.
    // For a problem where you're looking for target - nums[i], a hash map is perfect for instantly checking: "Have I seen the number I need before?"
    unordered_map<string,int> std_scores;

    // Why It's Useful: It's perfect for problems where you need to keep track of the "top K" items without sorting the entire collection. For example, you can maintain a priority queue of size k. As you process new items, you can compare them to the smallest item in your "top K" set and replace it if the new item is larger. This is much more efficient than sorting everything.

### 1 Concatenation of Array [Easy]
- https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/
> Google, Adobe, Facebook
---
**Ques**

You are given an integer array nums of length n. Create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

Specifically, **ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays**.

Return the array ans.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,4,1,2]

Output: [1,4,1,2,1,4,1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [22,21,20,1]

Output: [22,21,20,1,22,21,20,1]

```
Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000.
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

### 2 Contains Duplicate [Easy]
- https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/
> Airbnb, Amazon, Apple ,Microsoft, Tcs, Google, Yahoo, Oracle, Palantir-technologies, Adobe, Uber, Facebook, Bloomberg
---
**Ques**

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]

Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: false
```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.

Hint 1
A brute force solution would be to check every element against every other element in the array. This would be an O(n^2) solution. Can you think of a better way?


Hint 2
Is there a way to check if an element is a duplicate without comparing it to every other element? Maybe there's a data structure that is useful here.


Hint 3
We can use a hash data structure like a hash set or hash map to store elements we've already seen. This will allow us to check if an element is a duplicate in constant time.

---
**Solutions**
- So in this ques array
  - if any any element occurence >1 or **have duplicates**
      - **return true**
  - else 
      - then the array have distinct elements
      - return false
- Solution 1 **-- brute force**
  - we are **checking each element to find it's same value by traversing each array eachtime**
  - given nums vect array
  - let n = nums vect array length
  - let counter = 0
  - if counter become more than 1 , i.e. item has multiple occurence 
  - for i 0->n-1
      - for j 0->n-1
          - if nums[i]==nums[j] ( not i==j )
              - counter++
              - **if counter>1**
                  - **return true**
      - counter = 0 // reset counter for next elements turn
  - return false // at case where counter didnt inc from 1 , i.e. not even onces occurence
```cpp
// Solution 1
class Solution {
public:

**Ques**

Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

> Anagram :
> Multiple String Arrays where each have
>   1. Same Elements
>   2. Same Length 
>   3. Different Order 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```
Constraints:
```
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
```

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n + m) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the string s and m is the length of the string t.

Hint 1
A brute force solution would be to sort the given strings and check for their equality. This would be an O(nlogn + mlogm) solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way without sorting the given strings?

Hint 2
By the definition of the anagram, we can rearrange the characters. Does the order of characters matter in both the strings? Then what matters?

Hint 3
We can just consider maintaining the frequency of each character. We can do this by having two separate hash tables for the two strings. Then, we can check whether the frequency of each character in string s is equal to that in string t and vice versa.

**Solutions**

- "anagram" has {a:3, n:1, g:1, r:1, m:1 } , "nagaram" has same {a:3, n:1, g:1, r:1, m:1 } thus anagram 
- So basically if both string array have same elements despite any order , they are anagram
- thought: 
  - so we have to check count of alphabets of both strings and compare
  - sounds like hashmap stuff
  - YES
- Solution 1
  - Sort Both String Arrays
  - check 1 if both lenght are equal or not
  - check 2 traverse and check each element of both array for equality
  - Downside of This STL Sort
    - Differs from lang to lang
    - good sort algos do O(nlogn)
    - bad sort algos do O(n**2)
    - uncertain of SC
    - uncertain of TC
    - lenghty at cases where STL is not available

```cpp
// Solution 1
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        if (s.size() != t.size()) { return false; }
        for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
            if (s[i]!=t[i]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;

        
    }

// Space complexity:

```

- Solution 2
  - sort both s & t
  - return s==t ?

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());

- thought: Acc to ASCII, lets assume each char as a number bars

**Ques**

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]
```
Constraints:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 10,000,000
-10,000,000 <= target <= 10,000,000
```

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.


Hint 1
A brute force solution would be to check every pair of numbers in the array. This would be an O(n^2) solution. Can you think of a better way? Maybe in terms of mathematical equation?


Hint 2
Given, We need to find indices i and j such that i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target. Can you rearrange the equation and try to fix any index to iterate on?


Hint 3
we can iterate through nums with index i. Let difference = target - nums[i] and check if difference exists in the hash map as we iterate through the array, else store the current element in the hashmap with its index and continue. We use a hashmap for O(1) lookups.

**Solutions**
- so basically, 
  - given
    - Array
    - target
  - to find
    - index i &index j of array
    - && arr[i]+arr[j]=target
    - && i != j
    - Return the answer with the smaller index first.
    - You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.
- Solution 1 -- brute force
  - loop 1 : i 0 to n-1
    - loop 2 : j i+1 to n-1
      - if arr[i]+arr[j]=target
        - return {i,j}
  - if not found ,return {}

                if (nums[i]+nums[j] == target) { return {i,j} ; }

```
- thought: let's just make checks of `(nums[i]+nums[nums.size()-i-1] == target`
  - NO, as ans can be `[0,1]`
- thought: arr[i]+arr[j]=target
  - arr[j]=target-arr[i]
  - we know target, if we just do hardwork to know arr[i] then, arr[j] will automatically come
  - YES, but then we can see arr[j] but need to extract index j 
- thought: change the data stucture
  - hashset: NO, `( hashbrown.find(nums[i] )` only returns ptr, not index, tip
  - hashmap: YES, with < value, index > 
  - pairs: YES, with < value, index > 
  - YES 
- Solution 2
  - Hash Map (Two Pass)
  - here we are finding i then j
    - { i,hash_map[target-nums[i]] }
  - make hashmap 
    - where hashmap[value]=index
  - now loop traverse, first add all array elements with index nos. in hashmap
  - then another loop, to check
    - if element's Right Side Complement exists
      - i.e. target - arr[i] exists
      - , i.e. arr[j] && target - arr[i] != arr[i] ( i.e. not point back to same element )
      - we are checking if the element 1's complement to sum the target exists to the RIGHT SIDE
      - i.e. element + Right Side Complement = target 
    - if YES, then return the i ,then j as {i,j}
  - if nothing found, it didn't exist, return empty {}

      - NO
          - The problem is that the correct pair isn't always symmetrical. The solution might be the 1st smallest and the 3rd largest
- Solution 4
  - Sorting  
  - This is the two-pointer technique. I just need to put this logic into a while (left < right) loop. It's guaranteed to find the solution.
  - thought: if we use value_index_pairs_vector instead of vector array. Let's go back to the sorted list and think again. I have one pointer at the start (left) and one at the end (right).
    - The Core Question: I have sum = left_value + right_value. How does this sum guide my next move?
    - Case 1: sum > target: The total is too big. To make it smaller, the only logical move is to decrease the larger number. So, I must move the right pointer inward (right--).
    - Case 2: sum < target: The total is too small. To make it bigger, the only logical move is to increase the smaller number. So, I must move the left pointer inward (left++).
    - YES
    - textbook-quality solution !!!

**Ques**

Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```
Explanation:
```
There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["x"]

Output: [["x"]]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: strs = ["a"]

Output: [["a"]]
```
 

Constraints:
```
1 <= strs.length <= 1000
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```

Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(m * n) time and O(m) space, where m is the number of strings and n is the length of the longest string.


Hint 1
A naive solution would be to sort each string and group them using a hash map. This would be an O(m * nlogn) solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way without sorting the strings?


Hint 2
By the definition of an anagram, we only care about the frequency of each character in a string. How is this helpful in solving the problem?


Hint 3
We can simply use an array of size O(26), since the character set is a through z (26 continuous characters), to count the frequency of each character in a string. Then, we can use this array as the key in the hash map to group the strings.

---

**Solutions**
- basically  
  - given array of strs
  - return array of sublists of anagram string groups
- thought: You're trying to use a std::vector like a dictionary or a hash map, where you can look up a value using a string key. 
  - NO
  - However, a std::vector in C++ doesn't work that way; it's just a dynamic array that you can access with integer indices (like tempo[0], tempo[1], etc.). It doesn't have a .find() method that takes a string, nor can you use a string inside the square brackets [].
- thought: The perfect tool for this is a std::unordered_map. It allows you to store key-value pairs, which is exactly what you need: the sorted string as the key and the list of anagrams as the value.
  - YES
- Solution 1 -- brute force
  - Sorting
  - thought: 
    - i grouped them based on id as identity of sorted string
    - so i need to do one sort operation each traversal to find id which is sorted str
    - YES
  - make unord hashmap tempo
    - contain stuff as pairs {"abc", {"acb", "bac"}}
      - "abc"
      - {"acb", "bac"}
  - traverse through array of strs
    - each element
    - sort it using sort stl
    - if sorted string exists in tempo
      - append the element in sorted pair 
    - else
      - make pair of 
        - sorted element key
        - empty array
  - make new vector of vector of string fin
  - traverse through tempo 
    - append second of pair into fin
  - return fin
  - TC
    - for each str : n log n from sort
    - for arra of m elements : m* n log n
```cpp
// Solution 1
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map< string, vector<string> > tempo;

        for ( int i=0 ; i<strs.size() ; i++){
            // one string iteration "string1" strs[i]
            string s = strs[i]; 
            sort(s.begin(),s.end()); // s is sorted strs[i]
            
            // Add the original string to the vector associated with the sorted key.
            // If the key doesn't exist, C++ creates it automatically!
            tempo[s].push_back(strs[i]);
        //     if ( tempo.find(s) != tempo.end ) // if s exist in tempo
        //     {
        //         // append strs[i] in tempo[s] tempo[s].push_back(strs[i])
        //         tempo[s].push_back(strs[i]);
        //     }
        //     else 
        //     {
        //         // make new str,{} in tempo
        //         tempo[s].push_back(strs[i]);
        //     }
        }
        vector<vector<string>> fin;
        for ( auto const& pairs: tempo){ // eg: pair { "abc", {array of anagrams} } 
            fin.push_back(pairs.second);
        }
        return fin;
    }
};

```
- Solution 2 -- optimal
  - Hash Map/Table
  - same working of Solution 1 
  - but another ID
  - thought: 
    - i grouped them based on id as identity
    - so i did earlier to do one sort operation each traversal to find id which is sorted str
    - is there any other way to make ids and group play??
    - idea: make an id
    - made of 0s and 1s of freq array of 26 alphabet & one seperator
      - eg: abc => 1.1.1.0.0.0.0..........................0
        - bca => 1.1.1.0.0.....................0
          - same as abc, cab, bac etc.
    - YES, really like adj matrix 
  - TC: 
    - just using hashmap
    - just counting stuff
    - O( m * n * 26 )
      - n is elements size
      - m is array size
      - 26 is Alphabets iteration 
```cpp
// Solution 2
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map< string, vector<string> > tempo;
        for ( const string& s : strs)
        {
            // Create a character count array for each string
            // An array of 26 integers, one for each letter 'a' through 'z'.
            vector<int> freq(26,0);
            for (char c: s)
            {
                freq[c-'a']++;
            }
            // Build a unique key string from the count array.

            // Key might look like: "1.0.0.0.1.....1...."
            string _ID = "";
            for ( int i =0; i<26; i++)
            {
                _ID+= to_string(freq[i]);
                _ID+="."; // as a seperator

**Ques**

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

Output: [2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

Output: [7]
```
Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.
```
Recommended Time & Space Complexity
You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.

Hint 1
A naive solution would be to count the frequency of each number and then sort the array based on each elementâ€™s frequency. After that, we would select the top k frequent elements. This would be an O(nlogn) solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way?

Hint 2
Can you think of an algorithm which involves grouping numbers based on their frequency?

Hint 3
Use the bucket sort algorithm to create n buckets, grouping numbers based on their frequencies from 1 to n. Then, pick the top k numbers from the buckets, starting from n down to 1.

**Solutions**
- this question seems to be easy
- but this is quite hard to solve once
- basically
  - Given an integer array nums and an integer k
  - return the k most frequent elements within the array.
  - The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.
- thought : 
  - was blackout, full algo didn't came at first try
  - origin thinking was to make a map containing freq, element 
  - sort them desc
  - make fin arr
  - and while k--
    - append fin freq's element
  - return
  - NO
    - was beginner, other way too as iteration 
  - Solution 1 came out of incapability of using just unordered_map or vector or vector pair
    - i tried here to use their synergy
    - YES
  - Will try this thought inspiration in Sol 2
    - YES

- Solution 1 -- optimal
  - Bucket Sort
  - Need to Revisit after Getting Grip
  - thought: the "bucket" array, where the index represents the frequency (count) Advantage
    ```
    eg:
    [1,1,2,2,2,3,10]
    - this is unbounded
      - i.e. maxelement of this array exceed size of array
      - i.e. any element 100000,99999,etc. can be in this array
      - COUNT IS BTW TIMES OF OCCURENCE
    - way 1 to store
      - i :       [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] IDX  
      - count :   [0,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] VALUES 
    - way 2 to store -- optimal
      - count : [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] IDX 
      - i : [[null],[10,3],[1],[2],X,X,X] VALUES
      - very much TC & SC Efficient
      - + new way to process
        - also even if array is big, still stop way 2 bucket till k , ignore after that
          - starting from reverse obv.
          - i.e. if k=2, so 
            - 6,5,4 is out ,no data
            - process 3,2
            - ignore rest !!!
        - linear time
    ```
  - The two-step process is the standard, efficient pattern.
  - Use a map for what it's best at: fast lookups and counting.
  - Use a vector for what it's best at: storing data in a sequence that can be sorted.
  - make map named tempo
    - {{number,freq},{number,freq},{number,freq}}
    - Count the frequency of each number.
  - make bucket vector tempo2
    - {{number,number,number},{number,number,number},{number,number,number}}
  - here 0 index vector have 0 freq nos, 1 index nos have 1 freq nos, etc
  - 0 would be {} obv
    - useage
  - eg: buckets[5] = a list of all numbers that appeared exactly 5 times.
  - eg: buckets[4] = a list of all numbers that appeared exactly 4 times.
  - now traverse tempo
    - store tempo2[freq].push_back(number)
  - done
  - now to just append to fin array and return fin
  - actual_size_bucket = tempo2.size() -1
  - travers tempo2 reverse order
    - You can't sort the buckets vector itself, because the frequency information is stored in its indices, not in the values it holds. Sorting it would scramble this crucial relationship.
    - so now
    - traverse i lastFreq -> 0 && fin<=k
  - for nums in tempo[i]
    - fin.push_back(nums)
  - check if fin==k
    - The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique
    - break
  - else
    - continue
  - return fin
```cpp

        // Connecting Frequency to Array Indexing To store the number 5 in our buckets vector, we need to place it at the index corresponding to its frequency. So, we need to access buckets[4].

// Note: 'entry.first' is the number, 'entry.second' is its frequency.
    for ( auto& i : count){

// Push the {frequency, number} pair onto the min-heap.
// We put frequency *first* so the heap sorts by frequency.
        hp.push( {i.second,i.first} ) ;


// This is the key optimization:
// If the heap's size exceeds 'k', we remove the smallest element.
// Since it's a min-heap, 'heap.pop()' removes the element with the 
// *lowest frequency* currently in the heap.
        if ( hp.size() > k) {hp.pop();}
    }   


// After the loop, the heap contains exactly the 'k' elements 
// with the highest frequencies.

// 3. --- Final Result ---

// Create a vector 'res' to store our final result.
    vector<int> fin; 

// Loop 'k' times to extract all elements from the heap.
// (Alternatively, you could use 'while (!heap.empty())')
    for( int i = 0; i<k ; i++){

// Get the top element from the heap (which is a {frequency, number} pair).
// 'heap.top().second' accesses the 'number' part of the pair.
        fin.push_back(hp.top().second); 
        // NO fin.push_back(hp.top().second());
        // NO fin.push_back(hp.top.second());
        // NO fin.push_back(hp.top.second);

// Remove the top element from the heap to access the next one.
        hp.pop();
    }

// Return the 'res' vector containing the top k frequent numbers.
// Note: The order in 'res' isn't guaranteed (e.g., it might be 
// from k-th most frequent to 1st most frequent), but the problem 
// usually allows any order.
    return fin;
    }
};
// Time & Space Complexity
// Time complexity: 
// O(nlogk)
// Space complexity: 
// O(n+k)
// Where 
// n is the length of the array and 
// k is the number of top frequent elements.

You are an expert C++ tutor. Your goal is to teach me the necessary concepts to solve a specific coding problem, but without revealing the final answer's logic. I will provide you with both the problem description and the complete, working C++ solution. Based on this information, you must first identify all the core programming concepts, data structures, and C++ features used in the solution. Then, for each of these topics, you must explain it to me from a beginner's perspective. Each explanation should cover what the concept is, why it's useful in general, its basic C++ syntax, and a small, self-contained code snippet that demonstrates only that single concept in isolation. It is crucial that you do not explain the line-by-line logic of the solution I provided or combine your examples into the final answer. Your entire purpose is to give me the individual building blocks so that I can construct the final solution myself.
